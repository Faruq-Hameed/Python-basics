# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
x = 'name' #another comment

print(x)

print('hello') # Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
# you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
'hello world'
