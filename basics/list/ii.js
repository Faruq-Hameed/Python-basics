1. Do you agree with Mr. Chiozor's view of the development model to be used?

Answer: 
No, I disagree with Mr. Chiozor's view of using the Spiral model and recommend using the Agile methodology for the following reasons:

 Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows for iterative development and continuous feedback, which is crucial for adapting to the evolving requirements and business needs of DreamEVENT.
Customer Involvement: Agile promotes active customer collaboration, ensuring that the CEO and branch managers can provide continuous input, leading to a product that better aligns with their expectations.
 Frequent Deliverables: Agile delivers functional software at the end of each iteration (sprint), allowing DreamEVENT to see progress and make adjustments quickly.
Quick Identification of Issues: Regular testing and feedback cycles in Agile help identify and address issues early, reducing the risk of major defects at later stages.

 2. Categorize the requirement of the client

Answer:
1. Functional Requirements:
  Management of all branch activities
  Project documentation management
  Project management tools
  Payroll management
  Financial reporting

2. Non-Functional Requirements:
  User-friendliness (considering 88% of the staff are unskilled labor)
  Scalability (to handle the growing operations and multiple branches)
  Reliability and robustness
  Security (particularly for financial and payroll data)
  Performance (efficient handling of operations across all branches)

 3. What testing type will you recommend?

Answer:
- Functional Testing: To ensure each feature meets the specified requirements.
- Usability Testing: Given the high percentage of unskilled labor, ensuring the system is easy to use is critical.
- Integration Testing: To ensure that all modules work together seamlessly.
- System Testing: To test the complete system for compliance with requirements.
- Regression Testing: To ensure new changes do not negatively affect existing functionalities.
- Performance Testing: To ensure the system performs well under the expected load.
- Security Testing: To protect sensitive financial and payroll information.

 4. Identify all stakeholders and, hence, identify the various actors and use cases that apply to them

Answer:

Stakeholders:
- Elizabeth Walden (Founder/CEO of DreamEVENT)
- Branch Managers (Essex, Manchester, Leeds, York, Aberdeen)

Actors and Use Cases:

Actors:
1. CEO (Elizabeth Walden)
2. Branch Managers
3. HR Department
4. Finance Department
5. Project Managers
6. Employees
7. ITSolves Development Team

  View assigned tasks and schedules

7. ITSolves Development Team:
  Develop and integrate new features
  Perform testing and bug fixes
  Provide technical support and training

 5. From your own perspective, what testing type do you think we can use?

Answer:
- Unit Testing: Each component or module should be tested individually to ensure it works correctly in isolation.
- Integration Testing: After unit testing, combined modules should be tested to ensure they work together properly.
- System Testing: The complete system should be tested to ensure all requirements are met.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): End-users should test the system to ensure it meets their needs and is user-friendly.
- Regression Testing: To confirm that new changes haven’t adversely impacted existing functionality.
- Performance Testing: To verify that the system can handle the expected load and performs well under stress.
- Security Testing: To ensure that the system protects sensitive data and is secure against threats.
- Usability Testing: Given the significant proportion of unskilled labor, it's crucial to ensure the system is intuitive and easy to use.

 Recommendations for the Lack of IT Department

Answer:
Given that DreamEVENT does not currently have a dedicated IT/IT Support department, it is important to establish a plan for maintaining the application and providing ongoing support:

1. Outsource IT Support: Partner with a reliable IT support company that can provide ongoing maintenance, updates, and technical support for Operations_Complete.
2. Training: Conduct training sessions for key employees to ensure they can handle basic troubleshooting and system operations.
3. Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for the software, including user manuals, troubleshooting guides, and maintenance procedures.
4. Help Desk: Set up a help desk system (possibly with the IT support company) to handle user issues and requests promptly.
5. Regular Updates: Schedule regular software updates and maintenance to keep the system secure and functioning optimally.
6. Monitoring and Alerts: Implement monitoring tools to track the system’s performance and generate alerts for any issues, ensuring quick resolution.
7. Disaster Recovery Plan: Develop a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of major system failures or data loss.

By adopting Agile methodology and addressing the maintenance and support needs effectively, DreamEVENT can ensure the successful upgrade and ongoing operation of their software system, leading to improved efficiency and satisfaction across their branches.
