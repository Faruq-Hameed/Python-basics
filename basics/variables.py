# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

y= "name"
# Expressions surrounded by backticks are not supported in Python 
# z= `name` //ERROR

# Variable names are case-sensitive.
x= 'john'
X= 'name'
print('x is ', x, '\n', 'X is =', X)

# Variable Names:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

name= 'var-name'
var_name = 'name_name'
_name= 'john'
# name-one= 'John' ERROR CODE
